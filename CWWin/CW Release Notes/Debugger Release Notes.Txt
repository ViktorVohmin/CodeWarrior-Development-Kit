==================================
Metrowerks CodeWarrior Debugger
==================================

Version	1.6.1
Date 	January 22, 1997


1. Minimum System Requirements

* 486 or better with 16 MB of RAM
* Windows95 or WinNT4  (WinNT 3.51 is not supported with the current version)

2. Notes

* Visual C++ users will recognize F5, F10, Shift-F10, F11, and Shift-F11 as
run, step over, stop, step in, and step out.

* If the fonts look really bad in the register and memory views, make sure
that you have the "Courier New" font installed on your machine.  This font
is part of a normal install of Windows NT or 95, but if it isn't installed,
those views don't look nice.


3. Changes/Bug Fixes

* Removed references to MetroNub, the Mac debugger plugin.

* Watchpoints now work but there is currently no visual feedback in the
memory and globals windows.  The watchpoints window correctly displays the
values of the watchpoints.

* The help files for the application are located in the "(Help)" directory
which is a sibling of "Bin".  

* The log window is now named <application_name>.log.  It shows up
in the windows menu correctly and inserts the correct name in the
save dialog.

* The help files for the application will be located in the "(Help)" directory
which is a sibling of "Bin". 

* Fixed "map inconsistent" error in expressions window.

4. Known Bugs

* Known problems launching debugger and opening .pse file from the IDE.

* In an array window, the "Struct Member" control doesn't operate properly.

* If you encounter "Directory Not Found" or "-120" when launching or 
quitting a debuggee, it probably has something to do with the Resource 
Manager.  Macintosh resources are stored under Win32 in a directory named 
"Resource.FRK".  If the file already exists, but not in the Resource.FRK 
directory, the Resource Manager may not find the correct file.  Delete, 
rename, or move the associated ".DBG" file and try again.

* If the main Debugger window is very small and you open the process or
target windows, the scrollers are given the wrong sizes and it is not
possible to resize them to the correct size.

* The debugger plugins are not unloaded once they are loaded.

* If you are viewing assembly and choose "Source" and the file can't be
found, cancelling the find file dialog will result in the button
displaying "Source" rather than "Assembly"
