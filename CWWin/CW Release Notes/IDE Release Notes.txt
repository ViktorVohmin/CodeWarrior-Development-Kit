- The IDE is not capable of saving a fileset in the Find dialog
- Many redraw & update problems

4. Additional Notes

[IDE]
- If you see the line count stop during compiling, this means that the compiler
  has crashed. Please report this and send us the sources
  to reproduce the problem.

[PlayStation Plugin]
- The PlayStation postlinker now creates a file called 

<projectname>.pxe 
rather than
<projectname>.pse.EXE

This is the file that should be burned on the PlayStation CD for
mass-production. You will have to rename the file to
<projectname>.EXE when you attempt to actually use the file
for production.
