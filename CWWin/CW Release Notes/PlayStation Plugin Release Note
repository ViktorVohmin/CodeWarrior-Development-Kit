2. Notes

3. Changes/Bug Fixes

4. Known Bugs

* The "printf" command, when executed on the Net Yaroze may not complete 100% of the
time when running at 115kbps. This will cause the Net Yaroze to hang. If you see this
often, try reducing the debug speed to 56.7 kbps.

* struct {} variables will be shown with a symbol type of <Record Of>
rather than <Struct>. 

* If a conditional breakpoint is set in a location that is called very
frequently (more than once per second or so), the stack window will not be
updated to show that the process is running. It will remain at the source
display.

* If a watchpoint is set and the user hits run, the entire UI will hang until
the watchpoint is found. This prevents quitting or doing anything else with
the debugger until the watchpoint is found.
