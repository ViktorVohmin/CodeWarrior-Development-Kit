About Metrowerks Documentation Formats

Metroworks documentation for Windows-hosted tools comes in three formats.

PDF flags the Adobe Acrobat format. Acrobat Reader allows you to both view
the documentation on your computer and print it. However, you'll have to
install Acrobat Reader to use these files. Acrobat has hypertext links. These
files are suitable for both the Mac OS and Windows platform.

You will also find some documentation in HTML format, particularly for Java
tools. To view this documentation, you can use your favorite HMTL browser, or
Internet Explorer which comes with CodeWarrior.

You can access all the documentation through the CodeWarrior Documentation.htm
file. Double-click it to launch Internet Explorer.

Finally, some documentation is available in WinHelp format. Access this
documentation through the Help menu of the IDE, Debugger, or Constructor.
