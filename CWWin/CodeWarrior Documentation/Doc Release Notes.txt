For an overview and description of all CodeWarrior documentation,
double-click the CodeWarrior Documentation.htm file.

Please read the release notes for the latest information on the particular
tools. The Metrowerks documentation team does its best to be 100% accurate
and complete while writing clear and easily understood manuals about our
tools. However, because of the rapid pace of development certain elements in
the documentation may be inaccurate. Writers are always one step behind the
engineers, and that is as it should be. The release notes will have a
description of any last-minute changes or features.


CodeWarrior Help Files

CodeWarrior for Windows DR1 comes with help files for the three principal
tools that have a UI - the CodeWarrior IDE, the Debugger, and Constructor.
In addition, there is a help file that contains information about compiler
and linker errors. There are known problems with each of these files.

IDE - graphics are frequently poor quality. In addition, two chapters
      are missing from the contents, "Compiling and Linking" and "Setting
      Options." This information is in the help file, just not in the 
      contents. You can access these chapters through the index.

Error Reference - has many links that go to the wrong place. These will
      be fixed as soon as possible, and an update made available on the
      Metrowerks web site, www.metrowerks.com

Debugger - just about every item in the index begins with the letter k.

Constructor - the information on the bitmap editor uses screenshots from
      the Mac OS hosted tools because these features were still under
      development.
