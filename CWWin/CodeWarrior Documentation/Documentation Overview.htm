You can use CodeWarrior to write code for a wide variety of computer targets, including Mac OS, Windows 95/NT, Be OS, and several more. The CodeWarrior tools run on three host operating systems: Mac OS, Windows 95/NT, and Be OS.</P><P>The CodeWarrior core documentation is modular, just like the underlying tools. There are manuals for the core tools, the languages, and each target.</P><P>The core tool manuals are the IDE User Guide, the Debugger Manual, and the CodeWarrior Error Reference. These manuals are "target-neutral" in that they discuss how to use the tools to program for any CodeWarrior target. Occasionally, target-related issues are discussed, because you can't program (or write about programming tools) in a vacuum. However, the goal of the core tools manuals is to show you how to use the CodeWarrior tools generally, not how to program for a specific target. There are three versions of the User Guide and the Debugger manual. Each version is intended to describe CodeWarrior as it runs on one of three CodeWarrior hosts: Mac OS, Windows 95/NT, and Be OS. The Error Reference is host-neutral and is the same for all host systems.</P><P>There are two language manuals: the C/C++/Asm Language Reference, and the Pascal Language Reference. These manuals describe how the Metrowerks compilers interpret source code in the particular language. These manuals are important references for compiler-related issues. Metrowerks also includes the Java Language Specification, from Sun MicroSystems, with products that include the Java tools.</P><P>There is also a series of targeting manuals, one for each target supported by CodeWarrior. The targeting manuals discuss target-specific issues such as what kinds of projects you can build, what libraries to include, special debugging considerations, and so forth. In this context, the Java virtual machine is considered a target. As a result there is a Targeting Java manual (in those products that include Java tools). In addition to the Targeting manuals, additional documentation shows you how to port projects to the Mac OS, and how to program for Windows.</P><P>The exact documentation provided with any Metrowerks CodeWarrior product is tailored to the tools included with the product. However, all products include the core tool manuals appropriate for the host operating system (Mac OS, Windows 95/NT, Be OS). Language and Targeting manuals are included as necessary.</P><P>Beyond the extensive core, language, and target documentation, Metrowerks provides additional documentation for standard libraries, application frameworks, and Metrowerks utility software. Once again, these manuals appear in products that include the library, framework, or tool described in the particular manual.</P><P>You will find all the documentation you need in the CodeWarrior Documentation folder included on the CD that comes with your CodeWarrior purchase.</P><p><hr size="1" noshade><p align="center">[<a href="../home.htm">home</a>|<strong>documentation</strong>|<a href="../CodeWarrior Books/CodeWarrior Books.htm">books</a>|<a href="../resources/products/start_here.htm">product info</a>|<a href="../resources/about/index.htm">about metrowerks</a>]</p><address>Copyright&copy; <A HREF="http://www.metrowerks.com">Metrowerks Corporation</A> 1996</address></p></BODY></HTML>
