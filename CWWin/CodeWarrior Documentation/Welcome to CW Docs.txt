Welcome to CodeWarrior Docs!

* I don't want to read this note, I want information fast!

Double-click the CodeWarrior Documentation.htm file to go quickly to a
hyperlinked description of all the manuals, both those included with this
product and other manuals available in the CodeWarrior universe.

Read the Release Notes for the various products! Some information in the
documentation may not be accurate because of last minute changes to
CodeWarrior. Refer to the Release Notes folder for this last minute
information.

The QuickStart guide will get you started. New users and users who have
purchased an update get a printed version of this guide. QuickStart gives you
background information about CodeWarrior, and points you to places to continue
learning, most particularly to the CodeWarrior Reference Web Site, a local (on
the CD) HTML site that can take you through all the documentation and to many
other places as well.

In every manual produced by Metrowerks you'll find the Guide to CodeWarrior
Documentation on the back page. Use this page to quickly point you to the
information you're looking for. Some of the manuals listed there are specific
to other hosts (such as the Mac-hosted tools) and may not be included with the
documentation for the Windows-hosted tools.


* Which documentation viewer do I use?

CodeWarrior documentation is available in Adobe Acrobat. Some documentation
is available in HTML or WinHelp. Acrobat provides hypertext navigation and
good searching features. You can use Acrobat for online reading and
searching, and for printing.


* I want paper manuals!

CodeWarrior documentation comes in electronic format to give you the latest
information and save you money. Metrowerks publishes its most important and
popular manuals in a series of volumes. Inside CodeWarrior for Windows should
be available about mid-December. Inside PowerPlant is available now. You can
order either (or both) of these manuals from Metrowerks Mail Order.

 - CodeWarrior IDE User's Guide  
 - Debugger Manual 
 - Error Reference  
 - C/C++/Asm Language Reference 
 - Pascal Language Reference

OS programming. This volume includes the following manuals:

for reporting bugs, questions, and suggestions are in the Release Notes
