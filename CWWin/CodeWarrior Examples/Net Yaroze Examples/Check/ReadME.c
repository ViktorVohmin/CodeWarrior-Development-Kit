1)
This project will NOT build until you have followed the instructions
in the document "Important!.rtf". This program uses libraries that are
not shipped with the CodeWarrior for PlayStation packages. These
libraries are supplied by Sony in your PlayStation developer package.

The instructions for converting these libraries are found in the
"Important!.rtf" document.

2) In order to run this program, you must boot the Net Yaroze
with the Black CD and then you must leave that CD in the unit
so that it can find the sound files.
