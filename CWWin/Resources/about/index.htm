<H1 align="center">About Metrowerks</H1>

<H3>Metrowerks has experienced tremendous growth in size and revenue.</H3>
<P>Founded in 1985, Metrowerks develops, markets and supports a complete line of Macintosh&reg;-hosted computer language products. The company has a customer base of over 50,000 registered users in 70 countries and employs more than 125 people. Revenue for fiscal 1995 was $5.1 million and revenue for fiscal 1996 was $10.6 million. In July 1996, Metrowerks common stock began trading on the NASDAQ national market under the symbol "MTWKF".</P>

<H3>Metrowerks' products set industry standards.</H3>
<P>The company's CodeWarriorr&reg; products are used to build applications for Mac<macro tm> OS, Windows&reg; 95, Windows NT<macro tm>, and Be OS<macro tm>, in addition to proprietary embedded operating systems such as Palm OS<macro tm> (used in U.S. Robotics&reg;' Pilot<macro tm> organizer) and PlayStation<macro tm> OS (used in Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation game console). CodeWarrior products, which provide full support for C, C++, Object Pascal and Java<macro tm> under one universal Integrated Development Environment (IDE), have become the industry standard for professional Mac-hosted software development. Over 80% of the Power Macintosh applications available today were built with CodeWarrior. Metrowerks also set industry standards with the inclusion of two free updates for every purchase of CodeWarrior. By releasing CodeWarrior three times a year, Metrowerks ensures its customers are in possession of state-of-the-art tools year round. </P>

<H3>Award-winning CodeWarrior helps developers meet software demands.</H3>
<P>CodeWarrior was the first native C/C++ and Pascal compiler product available for the Apple&reg; Power Macintosh. Released simultaneously with the Power Macintosh in 1994, CodeWarrior played a critical role in making the computer platform launch a success. Apple sold over one million units within the first nine months on the market, creating a large demand for PowerPC-native applications. CodeWarrior helped software developers create the applications to meet this demand. Well-received by the trade press throughout the year, CodeWarrior garnered five major awards, including the prestigious MacUser Editors' Software Product of the Year 1994.</P>

<H3>Partnerships lead to new products and expanded customer base.</H3>
<P>Metrowerks continues to strengthen its position as an industry leader by pursuing strategic partnerships with major industry players such as Apple Computer, Microsoft&reg; Corporation, Sun Microsystems&reg;, Be<macro tm> Inc., Motorola&reg;, U.S. Robotics and Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. CodeWarrior's front-end, back-end architecture allows new languages and computing platforms to be added to its Integrated Development Environment with relative ease. As a result, emerging markets benefit from the large number of developers already using CodeWarrior.</P>

<H3>Metrowerks plans to expand its product line and pursue other markets.</H3>
<P>Later in 1996, Metrowerks will release CodeWarrior for Embedded Systems, a new product line which will allow engineers to develop for embedded, or non-desktop, systems such as digital cameras, game consoles, TV set-top boxes, cellular phones, automobiles, etc. CodeWarrior for Embedded Systems will offer support for multi-purpose real-time operating systems and 32-bit microprocessors that are being used increasingly by consumer electronics manufacturers.</P>
<P>In November, Metrowerks will launch the first Windows 95/NT-hosted versions of CodeWarrior at the Comdex industry trade show, thereby making CodeWarrior's multi-platform tools available to the large base of developers using Wintel computers. While Metrowerks continues to aggressively expand its product line and pursue new markets, it never forgets or neglects the core of Power Macintosh programmers that have been the heart of the company's success.</P>
