MW CodeManager, the only commercial cross-platform source code control system for the Macintosh(R), is based on and compatible with Microsoft(R) Visual SourceSafe(TM) 4.0a. Designed for use by individual users or large, multi-platform project teams, MW CodeManager allows you to manage millions of lines of code in hundreds of files and maintain version control with ease.<P>Shorten your project development time safely. MW CodeManager maintains source code security while encouraging code reuse within and across project teams. Source files can be checked in and out easily, with large comment areas to describe the changes between versions. Storage space is preserved by using reverse-delta versioning, which stores only the latest changes between versions. You'll also keep track of the relationships between files and projects, so files are stored once, even if used by multiple project teams. MW CodeManager accommodates individual file sizes of up to 67 MB, sub-projects with over 8,000 files and more than four billion files total in projects nested up to 31 levels deep. Shadow directories allow automated build systems to have access to the absolute latest code without having to extract the entire source tree.<br clear="all"><H3>Specifications:</H3><ul>	<li>Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 4.0a compatible	<li>Configuration management in excess of 4 billion files	<li>Multi-platform file namespaces	<li>Cross-platform support available for Macintosh, DOS, Windows and UNIX	<li>Support for MPW 'ckid' resources	<li>31 levels of project nesting	<li>Over 8,000 files and sub-projects in a single sub-project	<li>Individuals file of up to 67MB, 32,767 revisions per file	<li>Multiple checkout	<li>RCS style keywords	<li>Password security	<li>Branching	<li>Labeling	<li>Delta storage	<li>Shadow directory support</ul><H3>Features</H3><ul>	<li>MPW tools	<li>MPW scripts for use with the CodeWarrior IDE and Finder	<li>AppleScripts for use with the CodeWarrior IDE and Finder	<li>CodeWarrior IDE Version Control System plug-in	<li>320-page user's guide	<li>Quick reference card	<li>Administrator application ( NEW )	<li>VCS plug-in for the CodeWarrior IDE (1.7 or later) ( NEW )	<li>Online help and documentation	<li>Technical support included with registration	<li>Two CD updates included with registration	<li>30-day money-back guarantee</ul><H3>Minimum Requirements</H3><ul>	<li>Motorola 68020 processor or higher	<li>PowerPC 601 processor or higher	<li>8 megabytes of RAM minimum, 16 megabytes of RAM recommended	<li>5 megabytes of disk space	<li>CD-ROM drive for installation	<li>Mac OS 7.1.2 or later	<li>For use with CodeWarrior: CodeWarrior IDE 1.7.2 or later	<li>For use with MPW: MPW 3.4 or later	<li>For use with ToolServer: ToolServer 3.4.1 or later</ul><p><p><hr size="1" noshade><p align="center">[<a href="../../../home.htm">home</a>|<a href="../../../CodeWarrior Documentation/CodeWarrior Documentation.htm">documentation</a>|<a href="../../../CodeWarrior Books/CodeWarrior Books.htm">books</a>|<strong><A HREF="index.htm">product info</A></strong>|<a href="../../about/index.htm">about metrowerks</a>]</p><address>Copyright&copy; <A HREF="http://www.metrowerks.com">Metrowerks Corporation</A> 1996</address></p></body></html>
