Exercises from DaveMark's "Learn C on the Macintosh" and "Learn C++ on the Macintosh" alongwith Jim Trudeau's "Programming Starter Kit for Macintosh" have beenconverted to Apple Guide files for expert help that is a mouse-click away,and loads of source code is included to help you get started on the road tosuccess.<P>The CD also contains special third-party tools and demos, and a World WideWeb Apple Guide file that leads you to programming resources on theInternet. When you are ready to develop for the Power Macintosh or otherplatforms, Metrowerks offers upgrade paths to both CodeWarrior Gold.<br clear="all"><p><br><hr><P><H3>Technical Specifications</H3>Discover Programming for Macintosh compiles for the Motorola 68020, 68030and 68040 Macintosh.  The 68K-native Macintosh compiler is built as a fatbinary, meaning that it runs native on both 68K and Power Macintoshsystems.  Applications compiled with Discover Programming for Macintoshwill run in emulation on the Power Macintosh, but will not be PowerMacintosh native.<P><B>Languages:</B>C/C++ and Object Pascal<P><B>Compilers:</B><br>C Compiler NIST Certified ANSI C with MPW extensions<br>C++ Compiler closely tracks the emerging ANSI/ISO C++ standard<br>Pascal Compiler NIST Certified ANS Pascal with MPW Pascal 3.3 compatibleextensions<br><P><B>Features</B><ul>     <li>C++ templates and zero overhead exception handling     <li>Multiple inheritance and RTTI support     <li>68K peephole optimizer     <li>MW Profiler 1.3.1     <li>PowerPlant application framework, with new networking classes     <li>PowerPlant Constructor view editor, with new, easy Menu Editor</ul><P><B>Debugging</B><ul>     <li>Source-level debugger for Macintosh     <li>Conditional breakpoints, data watchpoints and expression evaluation     <li>Raw memory hex dump in the debugger</ul><P><B>Other Features</B><ul>     <li>New online help and documentation (over 3,000 pages)     <li>New online PowerPlant book, including step-by-step tutorials     <li>Selected Apple developer tools and third-party SDK's     <li>Free technical support included with registration     <li>Localized for French, German, and Spanish     <li>30 day money-back guarantee</ul><P><B>Minimum Requirements</B><ul>     Motorola 68020 processor or higher, or<br>     PowerPC 601 processor or higher<p>     8 Megabytes of RAM<br>     System 7.1 or later<br>     CD-ROM drive for installation<br></UL><macro order><macro trademark><p><hr size="1" noshade><p align="center">[<a href="../../../home.htm">home</a>|<a href="../../../CodeWarrior Documentation/CodeWarrior Documentation.htm">documentation</a>|<a href="../../../CodeWarrior Books/CodeWarrior Books.htm">books</a>|<strong><A HREF="index.htm">product info</A></strong>|<a href="../../about/index.htm">about metrowerks</a>]</p><address>Copyright&copy; <A HREF="http://www.metrowerks.com">Metrowerks Corporation</A> 1996</address></p></BODY></HTML>
