# CodeWarrior-Development-Kit
IDE для разработка игр под PS1. Нужен Win95 или WinNT. На XP не работает, exe программы 16bit.

    Windows
    • An IBM-compatible 486 or higher computer. For best perfor-
    mance, a Pentium is recommended.
    • Either a PCI or ISA PlayStation development card, or the
    Let's Create Hobbyist Development System is required for
    PlayStation software development (see below for details).
    • Windows 95, or Windows NT 4.0.

    Macintosh
    • A Mac OS computer with a PowerPC processor. A Power
    Macintosh with a PCI bus is required to use the PCI develop-
    ment card.
    • Either a PCI PlayStation development card, or the Let's Cre-
    ate Hobbyist Development System is required for PlayStation
    software development.
    • Mac OS System 7.1.2 or later. CodeWarrior also needs Color
    QuickDraw, which is part of the Macintosh’s ROM software.

    Both
    • A CD-ROM drive to install the software.
    • A minimum of 16 MB RAM. 24MB or 32MB RAM is prefera-
    ble for PlayStation development. When using the CodeWar-
    rior IDE and debugger, 16MB may not provide the best
    performance.
    • The Sony Programmer Tool Kit or the Let's Create Hobbyist
    Development System, available exclusively from Sony Com-
    puter Entertainment, Inc.
    • An external television monitor for the PlayStation card, or a
    Power Macintosh equipped with video I/O. If your Mac OS
    computer has video I/O, you can use the Apple Video Player
    software as a PlayStation game console monitor on your
    Macintosh. The PlayStation card outputs NTSC as well as
    PAL.
    • A CD-ROM drive to install CodeWarrior software, documen-
    tation and examples.
    • Finally, the CodeWarrior for PlayStation Software Develop-
    ment CD.
